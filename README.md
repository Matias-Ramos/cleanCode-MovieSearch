# Purpose 
Project to demonstrate my current code quality (April 2024).

## Create a Movie Search Application
API to use: - https://www.omdbapi.com/  
_Get your API Key on the website by registering your email._

Requirements:

- Needs to show an input to search for the movie and a button to search. ðŸ†—
- List the movies and show the title, year, and poster. ðŸ†—
- Make the form work. ðŸ†—
- Fetch data from the API. ðŸ†—
- Make the movies display in a responsive grid. ðŸ†—

Additionals:
- Handle errors. ðŸ†—
- Prevent the same search from being done twice in a row. ðŸ†—
- Make the search happen automatically as you type. ðŸ†—
- Prevent the search from happening continuously while typing (debounce). ðŸ†—
