# Purpose 
Project to demonstrate my current code quality (April 2024).

## Create a Movie Search Application
API to use: - https://www.omdbapi.com/  
_Get your API Key on the website by registering your email._

Requirements:

- Needs to show an input to search for the movie and a button to search. 🆗
- List the movies and show the title, year, and poster. 🆗
- Make the form work. 🆗
- Fetch data from the API. 🆗
- Make the movies display in a responsive grid.

Additionals:

- Prevent the same search from being done twice in a row.
- Make the search happen automatically as you type.
- Prevent the search from happening continuously while typing (debounce).
